## 🎯 **Handling Q&A**

### **"How is this different from Google Trips or TripIt?"**
"Great question! Those are aggregation tools—they organize what YOU find. NemoCode.io is an intelligent agent that THINKS and PLANS for you, considering weather, budget, and even your social media needs."

### **"Why did you choose Nemotron over GPT or Claude?"**
"Nemotron excels at reasoning tasks and agentic workflows. Its ability to break down complex problems into steps—like our Planner/Executor/Synthesizer architecture—makes it perfect for multi-step travel planning."

### **"What if the API calls fail?"**
"We built robust fallback systems. If real APIs fail, we use mock data to demonstrate functionality. In production, we'd implement retry logic and caching."

### **"Can you add more destinations?"**
"Absolutely! Our system works for any destination. We have mock data for popular cities, but the LLM can reason about any location with real API data."

### **"What's your target market?"**
"Millennials and Gen Z travelers who want personalized experiences but don't have time for extensive planning. Also great for first-time travelers or people planning group trips."
